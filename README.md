# Arsenian_CSCI2270_FinalProject1
My project will create an array consisting of the english alphabet with each member of the array being part of a linked list where words starting with that letter can be stored. The purpose of this project is to create a simple way to store words based upon the first letter that they start with. In addition to creating a convenient way to store files, this project also has several functions allowing you to easily add and delete words as well as count the number of words in the dictionary. Not only can one add words, but he can also leave definitions for words.
