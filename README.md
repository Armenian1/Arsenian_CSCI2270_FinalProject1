# Arsenian_CSCI2270_FinalProject1
PROJECT SUMMARY
My project will create an array consisting of the english alphabet with each member of the array being part of a linked list where words starting with that letter can be stored. The purpose of this project is to create a simple way to store words based upon the first letter that they start with. In addition to creating a convenient way to store files, this project also has several functions allowing you to easily add and delete words as well as count the number of words in the dictionary. Not only can one add words, but he can also leave definitions for words.

HOW TO RUN
Run using a Linux operating system on the CodeBlocks compiler. The main file, the Dictionary class cpp file and the Dictionary class h file are all included.

DEPENDENCIES
My program does not rely on any dependencies.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
Must be using a Linux operating system.

GROUP MEMBERS
I have accomplished this project on my own.

CONTRIBUTORS
Thus far there have been no contributors to my project.

OPEN ISSUES/BUGS
I have not yet seen a bug on my program, but there are several additional functions that can be created to add to the functionality of this program. For example, a function that alphabetizes all the words, or a function that returns the shortest/longest word of a letter. Another very helpful addition to this project would be freeing the memory of all of the DicitonaryWords elements created. It would make the process more effecient.
